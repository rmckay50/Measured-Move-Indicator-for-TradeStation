MEASURED MOVE TRADING SYSTEM - USER GUIDE
========================================

You now have THREE different tools to identify and trade measured move patterns:

========================================
TOOL 1: RADARSCREEN SCANNER
========================================
File: MeasuredMove_RadarScreen.txt

PURPOSE: Scan your watchlist to find stocks with measured move setups forming RIGHT NOW

HOW TO USE:
1. In TradeStation, create a new ShowMe Study or Indicator
2. Paste the code and compile
3. Add to RadarScreen
4. Add these columns:
   - MMSetup (main signal)
   - R1_Size% (size of initial move)
   - Pullback% (how much it pulled back)
   - Proj_Gain% (potential profit if pattern completes)

READING THE SIGNALS:
- 0 = No setup
- 1-10 = BULLISH setup (higher number = stronger)
- -1 to -10 = BEARISH setup (lower number = stronger)

WORKFLOW:
- Sort by MMSetup column
- Look for values of 5 or higher (bullish) or -5 or lower (bearish)
- Click on stock to view chart for confirmation
- Check if projected target aligns with support/resistance

ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS:
- MinMovePercent (3) - How big Range 1 must be
- MinPullback (25) - Minimum pullback percentage
- MaxPullback (75) - Maximum pullback percentage
- VolumeConfirm (true) - Require volume confirmation

========================================
TOOL 2: AUTOMATIC CHART INDICATOR
========================================
File: MeasuredMoveChart_Auto.txt

PURPOSE: Automatically detect patterns on any chart and show projected targets

HOW TO USE:
1. Create a new Indicator in EasyLanguage
2. Paste code and compile
3. Add to any chart (works on any timeframe)
4. The indicator will automatically identify setups

WHAT IT SHOWS:
- Plots an arrow when a setup forms
- Displays projected target level
- Shows all info in the Data Window
- Can enable audio/visual alerts

DATA WINDOW INFO:
When a setup is detected, you'll see:
- Direction (Bullish/Bearish)
- Range 1 Size
- Pullback Percentage
- Current Price
- Projected Target
- Distance to Target

BEST PRACTICES:
1. Let the indicator find patterns automatically
2. When signal appears, verify:
   - Is projected target near S/R level?
   - Does the pattern look clean?
   - Is volume confirming?
3. Use this for final confirmation before entry

SETTINGS:
- MinMovePercent (3) - Smaller number = more signals
- AlertOnSetup (false) - Set to TRUE for alerts

========================================
TOOL 3: MANUAL PROJECTION TOOL
========================================
File: MeasuredMoveManual_Chart.txt

PURPOSE: When YOU identify a pattern, this calculates and displays the target

HOW TO USE:
1. Create new Indicator
2. Paste code and compile
3. Add to chart where you see a pattern
4. Count bars back to key points:
   - Where did Range 1 START? (count bars back)
   - Where did Range 1 END? (count bars back)
   - Where did Range 2 END? (count bars back)
5. Input these numbers in the indicator settings
6. The tool draws lines and calculates target

EXAMPLE:
If looking at your screenshot:
- Range 1 started 20 bars ago (set Range1StartBar = 20)
- Range 1 ended 15 bars ago (set Range1EndBar = 15)  
- Range 2 ended 2 bars ago (set Range2EndBar = 2)

The indicator will:
- Draw horizontal lines at each level
- Calculate and display projected target
- Show target as dashed line extending forward

WHY USE THIS:
- You have sharp eyes for patterns
- Not all patterns are "textbook" 
- Gives you precise target calculations
- Helps plan entries and exits

========================================
RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
========================================

STEP 1 - SCANNING (End of Day or During Trading)
→ Use RADARSCREEN tool
→ Sort by MMSetup column
→ Look for values ≥ 5 (bullish) or ≤ -5 (bearish)
→ Note the Proj_Gain% to prioritize best opportunities

STEP 2 - CHART REVIEW
→ Click on identified stocks
→ Use AUTOMATIC CHART INDICATOR
→ Verify the pattern looks clean
→ Check: Does projected target hit obvious S/R?

STEP 3 - FINAL CONFIRMATION
→ For patterns you really like
→ Use MANUAL TOOL to fine-tune
→ Verify your interpretation of ranges
→ Get exact target level for orders

========================================
KEY TRADING RULES FOR MEASURED MOVES
========================================

✓ PATTERN REQUIREMENTS:
1. Range 1 must be clean impulse move (3%+ minimum)
2. Range 2 pullback should be 40-60% ideal (25-75% acceptable)
3. Range 3 should start with momentum shift
4. Volume should confirm the move

✓ TARGET VALIDATION:
→ Best setups: Target lands at obvious S/R level
→ Good setups: Target near round numbers or prior swing points
→ Skip: Target is in "no man's land" with no S/R

✓ ENTRY STRATEGIES:
- Conservative: Enter when Range 3 breaks above/below Range 2 high/low
- Aggressive: Enter on first momentum bar in Range 3 direction
- Scale in: Half position on signal, half on breakout

✓ RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Stop: Below Range 2 low (bullish) or above Range 2 high (bearish)
- Target: Projected level OR when price reaches S/R
- Trail stops as pattern develops

✓ WHEN TO SKIP:
- Pattern is too choppy/messy
- No clear S/R at target
- Volume is declining
- Target too close (< 2:1 risk/reward)

========================================
TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
========================================

RADARSCREEN:
- Run scans at market close for next day setups
- Higher "strength" values = cleaner patterns
- Cross-reference with your other scans

CHART INDICATORS:
- Use on multiple timeframes (daily, 60-min, 15-min)
- Same pattern on multiple TFs = stronger signal
- Adjust sensitivity based on volatility

GENERAL:
- Not every detected pattern will work - be selective
- The best patterns have targets at OBVIOUS levels
- Trust your eyes - if it looks messy, skip it
- Back-test on historical data to build confidence

========================================
CUSTOMIZATION TIPS
========================================

If getting TOO MANY signals:
- Increase MinMovePercent (try 5%)
- Tighten pullback range (try 40-60%)
- Require volume confirmation

If getting TOO FEW signals:
- Decrease MinMovePercent (try 2%)
- Widen pullback range (try 20-80%)
- Increase MaxMoveBars lookback

For different markets:
- Stocks: Use default settings
- Futures: Increase MinMoveBars (faster movement)
- Crypto: Widen pullback range (more volatile)

========================================
QUESTIONS OR ISSUES?
========================================

Common Issues:

Q: "Not finding any patterns"
A: Try reducing MinMovePercent or increasing MaxMoveBars

Q: "Too many false signals"
A: Be more strict with pullback range (40-60%) and require volume

Q: "Targets seem wrong"
A: Remember target = Range 1 size + Range 2 end price
   If looks off, use Manual tool to verify

Q: "Pattern detected but looks ugly"
A: Trust your eyes! Not every mathematical pattern is tradeable

========================================

ALL THREE TOOLS WORK TOGETHER:
1. RadarScreen finds opportunities
2. Auto Chart confirms the pattern  
3. Manual Tool validates your interpretation

Good luck with your measured move trading!
